# Custom Hooks System - Reusable State Logic

Breadcrumb: Docs > Architecture > Hooks System

## Feature Overview
The hooks system provides custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable stateful logic, UI interactions, and complex state management patterns. These hooks serve as the integration layer between the pure business logic functions and React components, providing clean APIs for common application patterns.

## Key Components

### State Management Hooks
- **`useCurrentTime.ts`**: Real-time clock functionality with automatic updates
- **`useOptimizedVariableState.ts`**: Performance-optimized variable state management
- **`useVariableSummaryCache.ts`**: Caching layer for expensive variable calculations

### Variable System Hooks
- **`useItemVariables.ts`**: Item-specific variable management and CRUD operations
- **`useVariableDefinitions.ts`**: Variable definition management with autocomplete support
- **`useVariableDescriptions.ts`**: Variable description editing and cross-linking
- **`useRelationshipBasedSummary.ts`**: Relationship-aware variable summary calculations
- **`useVariableFiltering.ts`**: Advanced variable-based filtering logic
- **`useVariableLinks.ts`**: Variable cross-reference link management and navigation

### UI Interaction Hooks
- **`useDebouncedValue.ts`**: Input debouncing for performance optimization
- **`usePopupPositioning.ts`**: Intelligent popup positioning with viewport awareness
- **`useVariablePopupNavigation.ts`**: Navigation state management for variable popups
- **`useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`**: Global keyboard shortcut handling
- **`useViewportHeight.ts`**: Responsive viewport height calculations

### Data Management Hooks
- **`useItemInstances.ts`**: Item instance lifecycle and execution tracking
- **`useVariableDescriptions_new.ts`**: Enhanced variable description system (new implementation)

## Data Flow

### Hook Integration Pattern
1. **Component Integration**: Components use hooks through standard React hook patterns
2. **Business Logic Delegation**: Hooks delegate complex logic to functions layer
3. **State Synchronization**: Hooks ensure UI state stays synchronized with global state
4. **Performance Optimization**: Hooks implement memoization and optimization strategies

### Custom Hook Composition
- Hooks compose smaller hooks to build complex functionality
- Shared logic extracted into utility hooks for reusability
- Error handling and loading states managed consistently across hooks
- Cleanup patterns ensure no memory leaks or stale closures

## Integration Points

### Functions Layer Integration
- **Pure Function Calls**: Hooks call pure functions from the functions layer for business logic
- **State Management**: Hooks manage the React-specific aspects of state (useEffect, useState)
- **Error Handling**: Hooks translate function-layer errors into UI-appropriate error states

### Components Layer Integration
- **Clean APIs**: Hooks provide simple, focused APIs to components
- **Performance Optimization**: Hooks handle optimization so components can remain simple
- **State Abstraction**: Hooks abstract complex state management from component logic

### Global State Integration
- **Context Integration**: Hooks integrate with global state through React Context
- **Action Dispatch**: Hooks handle action dispatching with proper error handling
- **State Subscription**: Hooks manage selective state subscription for performance

## Known Limitations/Considerations

### Performance Considerations
- **Optimization Responsibility**: Hooks are responsible for performance optimization (memoization, debouncing)
- **Re-render Management**: Careful dependency management to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks

### Hook Dependency Management
- **Complex Dependencies**: Some hooks have complex dependency arrays that require careful management
- **Stale Closure Prevention**: Hooks must carefully manage closures to prevent stale state references
- **Effect Coordination**: Multiple useEffect hooks require careful coordination to prevent race conditions

### Testing Complexity
- **Hook Testing**: Custom hooks require specialized testing approaches (React Testing Library hook testing)
- **State Management Testing**: Complex state interactions can be challenging to test comprehensively
- **Integration Testing**: Hook integration with components requires careful test design

## Development Notes

### Hook Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each hook has a focused, well-defined purpose
- **Composability**: Hooks designed to compose well with other hooks
- **Performance-First**: Performance optimization built into hook design from the start
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation

### Custom Hook Patterns
- **State + Effect Pattern**: Most hooks combine useState and useEffect for stateful logic
- **Memoization Pattern**: Extensive use of useMemo and useCallback for performance
- **Cleanup Pattern**: Consistent cleanup patterns in useEffect return functions
- **Error Boundary Integration**: Hooks designed to work well with error boundaries

### Extension Strategies
- **Hook Composition**: New functionality built by composing existing hooks
- **Generic Utilities**: Utility hooks provide building blocks for specific use cases
- **Plugin Architecture**: Hooks designed to support plugin-style extensions
- **TypeScript Integration**: Full TypeScript support with generic hook patterns

This hooks system provides the essential integration layer that connects the business logic in `src/functions/feature-description.md` with the UI components described in `src/components/feature-description.md`, while maintaining the clean architecture principles established in `src/feature-description.md`.
