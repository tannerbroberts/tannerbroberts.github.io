# Step 1: Analyze and Document Current Child Execution Logic

## Step Title & Dependencies
**Thoroughly analyze the current child execution logic to identify the root cause of the rendering issue**
- **Dependencies**: None (this is the first step)
- **Estimated Time**: 45 minutes

## Readiness Validation Step
Before implementing this step, verify:
1. All SubCalendar execution components are accessible and readable
2. Current test suite runs without errors
3. Can create test scenarios with multiple children
4. Have understanding of the expected vs actual behavior

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### âœ… Emoji Status: Completed

### Code Changes Required
**NO ACTUAL CODE CHANGES IN THIS STEP - ANALYSIS ONLY**

#### Files to Analyze
1. **`/Users/tannerbrobers/dev/ATP/src/components/execution/executionUtils.ts`**
   - Document how `getActiveChildForExecution` currently works
   - Identify the logic for determining active children in SubCalendar items
   - Document how time calculations are performed
   - Map out the relationship between parent start time and child start times

2. **`/Users/tannerbrobers/dev/ATP/src/components/execution/PrimaryItemDisplayRouter.tsx`**
   - Document how active children are used in rendering
   - Identify the connection between execution utils and UI rendering
   - Document the recursive rendering logic
   - Map out how children are passed to display components

3. **`/Users/tannerbrobers/dev/ATP/src/components/execution/PrimarySubCalendarItemDisplay.tsx`**
   - Document how children prop is handled
   - Identify rendering logic for child components
   - Document integration with execution status

### Analysis Documentation Required
Create detailed analysis files documenting:
- **Current Child Selection Logic**: How the system currently determines which child should be active
- **Time Calculation Flow**: How parent and child start times are calculated and used
- **Rendering Chain**: How active children flow from execution utils to UI components
- **Issue Root Cause**: Specific identification of where the logic fails for subsequent children
- **Test Scenarios**: Documentation of test cases that would expose the issue

### Testing Requirements
- Create test scenarios with SubCalendar items containing multiple children
- Document expected vs actual behavior for multi-child scenarios
- Verify the issue exists and can be reproduced consistently
- Test with different child start times and durations
- Document edge cases (overlapping children, gaps between children, etc.)

### Documentation Updates
- Create detailed analysis document explaining current behavior
- Document the specific bug and its symptoms
- Outline expected correct behavior
- Create visual diagrams showing time-based child execution flow
- Document test cases that should pass after fixes

## Final Step Instructions
The individual executing this plan should:
1. Thoroughly test the current behavior with multiple children
2. Document exactly where the logic fails
3. Provide clear evidence of the bug through test cases
4. Leave feedback on whether this analysis step was sufficient or if additional investigation is needed
5. Confirm readiness to proceed to the actual fix implementation
