# Step 5: Add Comprehensive Tests for Multi-Child Scenarios

## Step Title & Dependencies
**Create comprehensive test suite to verify multi-child SubCalendar execution works correctly**
- **Dependencies**: Steps 2-4 must be completed (all core fixes implemented)
- **Estimated Time**: 70 minutes

## Readiness Validation Step
Before implementing this step, verify:
1. Steps 2-4 are complete and basic multi-child execution is working
2. Manual testing shows children render in sequence correctly
3. Current test suite still passes (no regressions)
4. Understanding of edge cases that need test coverage

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### ‚ùå Emoji Status: Not Started

### Code Changes Required
#### Files to Create/Modify
1. **`/Users/tannerbrobers/dev/ATP/src/components/execution/__tests__/multiChildSubCalendar.test.ts`**
   - Create comprehensive test suite for multi-child SubCalendar scenarios
   - Test all execution phases with multiple children
   - Test various child timing configurations
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Test integration between execution utils and rendering components

2. **`/Users/tannerbrobers/dev/ATP/src/components/execution/__tests__/executionUtils.multiChild.test.ts`**
   - Add specific tests for fixed execution utility functions
   - Test getActiveChildForExecution with various child configurations
   - Test getChildExecutionStatus with multi-child scenarios
   - Test time calculations and phase transitions

#### Test Scenarios to Cover
##### Basic Multi-Child Scenarios
- SubCalendar with 2 children, no gaps
- SubCalendar with 3+ children, no gaps
- SubCalendar with children having different durations
- SubCalendar with gaps between children
- SubCalendar with delayed first child (gap at start)

##### Time-Based Transition Tests
- Test active child during each execution phase
- Test child transitions at exact boundary times
- Test before execution starts (pre-start phase)
- Test during gaps between children
- Test after all children complete

##### Edge Case Tests
- SubCalendar with single child (ensure no regression)
- SubCalendar with no children
- SubCalendar with overlapping child times
- SubCalendar with zero-duration children
- SubCalendar with children that extend beyond parent duration

##### Integration Tests
- Test PrimaryItemDisplayRouter with multi-child scenarios
- Test SubCalendarStatusBar updates during child transitions
- Test execution status calculation accuracy
- Test UI rendering updates during transitions

### Testing Requirements
#### Unit Tests Coverage
- **getActiveChildForExecution**: Test with all child configurations
- **getChildExecutionStatus**: Test status calculation throughout execution
- **PrimaryItemDisplayRouter**: Test child rendering and transitions
- **Child Start Time Calculations**: Test accuracy of timing calculations
- **Phase Detection**: Test correct phase identification

#### Performance Tests
- Test rendering performance during rapid child transitions
- Verify no memory leaks during extended execution sequences
- Test with large numbers of children (10+ children)
- Verify efficient re-rendering during child changes

#### Manual Test Scripts
Create documented manual test procedures for:
- Visual verification of child transitions
- Timing accuracy verification
- UI responsiveness during transitions
- Error handling and edge case behavior

### Documentation Updates
- Document all test scenarios and their expected outcomes
- Create test data generators for multi-child SubCalendar items
- Document edge cases discovered during testing
- Add performance benchmarks for multi-child execution
- Document any limitations or known issues discovered

## Final Step Instructions
The individual executing this plan should:
1. Create comprehensive automated test coverage for all multi-child scenarios
2. Ensure all tests pass and provide good coverage of the fixes
3. Document any edge cases or issues discovered during testing
4. Verify performance is acceptable for various child configurations
5. Leave feedback on test coverage completeness and any additional scenarios that should be tested
