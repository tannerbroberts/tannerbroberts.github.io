# Step 4: Fix PrimaryItemDisplayRouter Child Rendering Logic

## Step Title & Dependencies
**Ensure PrimaryItemDisplayRouter properly renders children throughout multi-child execution**
- **Dependencies**: Steps 2-3 must be completed (child selection and status calculation fixed)
- **Estimated Time**: 40 minutes

## Readiness Validation Step
Before implementing this step, verify:
1. Steps 2-3 are complete and child selection/status calculation work correctly
2. Active child detection is working properly in execution utils
3. Child transitions are happening at correct times
4. Understanding of how router connects execution logic to UI rendering

## Detailed Acceptance Criteria

### ‚ùå Emoji Status: Not Started

### Code Changes Required
#### Files to Modify
1. **`/Users/tannerbrobers/dev/ATP/src/components/execution/PrimaryItemDisplayRouter.tsx`**
   - Verify `getActiveChildForExecution` integration is working correctly
   - Ensure child start time calculation aligns with fixed execution logic
   - Update recursive rendering to handle child transitions properly
   - Fix any caching or memoization issues that might prevent child updates
   - Ensure proper re-rendering when active child changes
   - Handle edge cases in child rendering (no active child, transitions)

#### Expected Logic Updates
- **Active Child Integration**: Ensure router uses the fixed getActiveChildForExecution function correctly
- **Re-rendering Triggers**: Ensure component re-renders when active child changes
- **Child Start Time Calculation**: Verify child start times are calculated correctly for rendering
- **Recursion Handling**: Ensure recursive child rendering works throughout execution sequence
- **Performance Optimization**: Maintain efficient rendering while ensuring updates happen

#### Specific Areas to Check/Fix
- Dependency arrays in useMemo hooks to ensure proper re-calculation
- Active child detection logic integration
- Child start time calculation for recursive rendering
- Memory optimization that might prevent child updates
- Edge case handling when no child is active

### Testing Requirements
#### Unit Tests
- Test router with multi-child SubCalendar items
- Verify active child changes trigger re-rendering
- Test child start time calculations are accurate
- Test recursive rendering through multiple children
- Verify proper handling of no-active-child scenarios
- Test depth limiting still works correctly

#### Integration Tests
- Test full execution flow from router through to child rendering
- Verify child components render and update correctly during transitions
- Test with nested SubCalendar items (SubCalendar children with their own children)
- Ensure ExecutionView displays correct child throughout execution
- Test performance during rapid child transitions

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Create SubCalendar with multiple children of different types (Basic, SubCalendar, CheckList)
2. Start execution and verify first child renders correctly in ExecutionView
3. Wait for transition and verify second child renders correctly
4. Continue through all children to verify sequential rendering
5. Test with nested children (SubCalendar child with its own children)
6. Verify no flickering or performance issues during transitions

### Documentation Updates
- Document any changes made to rendering logic
- Update component comments to reflect multi-child handling
- Document integration with fixed execution utilities
- Add comments explaining child transition rendering
- Document performance considerations for multi-child scenarios

## Final Step Instructions
The individual executing this plan should:
1. Verify the router correctly integrates with fixed execution utilities
2. Ensure proper re-rendering happens during child transitions
3. Test thoroughly with various child types and nesting scenarios
4. Confirm no performance regression during rapid child changes
5. Leave feedback on rendering behavior and any remaining issues with child display
