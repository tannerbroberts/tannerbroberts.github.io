# SubCalendar Child Rendering Fix Implementation Plan

## Feature Overview
Fix the issue where SubCalendar items only properly render their first child task, but fail to render subsequent children during execution. This is a critical bug that prevents proper sequential execution of child tasks in SubCalendar items.

## Architecture Impact
This change affects the execution component hierarchy by:
- Fixing the `getActiveChildForExecution` function to properly determine the currently active child
- Ensuring proper time-based transitions between child tasks in SubCalendar items
- Maintaining consistent child rendering behavior across all execution phases
- Preserving all existing functionality while fixing the child transition logic

## High Level Details
The issue appears to be in the execution utilities where the system determines which child should be active at any given time. The current logic may not be properly handling:
1. Time-based transitions between children
2. Proper calculation of child execution windows
3. Handling of gaps between child executions
4. Sequential rendering of multiple children

## Step Breakdown
1. ✅ [Step 1](./subcalendar_child_rendering_fix_step1.md): Analyze and document the current child execution logic
2. ✅ [Step 2](./subcalendar_child_rendering_fix_step2.md): Fix getActiveChildForExecution function
3. ✅ [Step 3](./subcalendar_child_rendering_fix_step3.md): Update child execution status calculation
4. ✅ [Step 4](./subcalendar_child_rendering_fix_step4.md): Fix PrimaryItemDisplayRouter child rendering logic
5. ✅ [Step 5](./subcalendar_child_rendering_fix_step5.md): Add comprehensive tests for multi-child scenarios
6. ❌ [Step 6](./subcalendar_child_rendering_fix_step6.md): Validate fix with integration testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SubCalendar items properly render all scheduled children in sequence
- [ ] Child transitions happen at correct times based on start times and durations
- [ ] No regression in existing single-child SubCalendar behavior
- [ ] Gap periods between children are handled correctly
- [ ] All existing functionality is preserved
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for multi-child scenarios
- [ ] Performance is maintained during child transitions
- [ ] ExecutionView displays correct child at all times during execution

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Issues
1. **Time Calculation Errors**: Incorrect child start/end time calculations
2. **Race Conditions**: Issues with rapid child transitions
3. **Performance Impact**: Frequent re-calculations during execution
4. **Existing Functionality**: Breaking current working single-child scenarios

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Thorough Testing**: Add comprehensive test coverage for all child scenarios
2. **Incremental Fixes**: Fix one function at a time with validation
3. **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Handle empty children arrays, overlapping times, etc.
5. **Performance Optimization**: Use memoization for expensive calculations
