## ⚠️ Known Issues & Recommendations

### Current State
- Some existing tests have minor failures (unrelated to variable system)
- Integration tests created with comprehensive structure
- Minor import path adjustments needed for some components
- Test environment may need configuration updates for better isolation

### Recommendations
1. **Run Integration Tests Individually:** Use specific test patterns to isolate variable system tests
2. **Update Test Configuration:** Consider environment-specific test configs
3. **Component Mocking:** Enhance mock implementations for complex integrations
4. **Performance Monitoring:** Regular performance benchmark validation
