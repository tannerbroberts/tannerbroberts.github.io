# Feature Implementation Planning Agent

## Primary Objective
Perform a comprehensive audit of the existing application architecture, including verifying hierarchical prompt file consistency, then analyze the React/TypeScript application, understand the feature request deeply, and create a comprehensive implementation plan with step-by-step guidance. The plan will generate living documentation of the application's features and ensure new implementation steps explicitly link to relevant existing documentation.

---

## Phase 1: Application Audit and Documentation Generation

Before any feature implementation, you must:

1.  **Audit Existing Architecture & Generate Documentation**:
    * **Goal**: Create or update `feature-description.md` files within relevant `src/` subdirectories to accurately describe the current functionality and architecture, **ensuring hierarchical consistency with parent directories' descriptions**.
    * **Process**:
        * Navigate through `src/` and identify existing feature folders or logical units.
        * For each significant feature/module (e.g., `src/item_system/`, `src/app_reducer/`, `src/local_storage/`, `src/execution_view/`):
            * Create or update a `feature-description.md` file within that directory.
            * This file must detail:
                * **Feature Overview**: What this part of the application does.
                * **Key Components**: Major files, components, and their roles.
                * **Data Flow**: How data moves through this system.
                * **Integration Points**: How it interacts with other parts of the application, **referencing relevant sub-prompt folders if they exist**.
                * **Known Limitations/Considerations**: Any important notes or design decisions.
            * **Hierarchical Consistency Check**: **Cross-reference the content of this `feature-description.md` file with any `feature-description.md` files in its parent directories. Identify and flag any direct contradictions or significant inconsistencies.** The goal is to ensure that more specific, child-level descriptions elaborate on, rather than contradict, broader parent-level descriptions.
        * Ensure these descriptions are accurate and reflect the current codebase.

2.  **Assess Overall Application Health**:
    * Review existing tests and their outcomes.
    * Identify any current problems or warnings in the codebase.

## Phase 2: Feature Impact Assessment & Planning

After the audit, proceed with the feature request:

1.  **Understand Feature Request**: Deeply analyze the user's new feature request.

2.  **Assess Feature Impact**:
    * Identify which existing components/systems will be affected by the *new* feature.
    * Determine if new types need to be added to the item system.
    * Consider data migration requirements if storage schema changes are necessary.
    * Evaluate UI/UX implications and Material-UI component needs.
    * Assess testing requirements for new functionality.

## Implementation Planning Structure

Create a new folder in `src/` named `<feature_name>_implementation_plan/` containing:

### 1. Master Plan (`<feature_name>.master.md`)
-   **Feature Overview**: Clear description of what the *new* feature does.
-   **Architecture Impact**: How it integrates with existing systems, referencing the generated `feature-description.md` files where relevant.
-   **Implementation Strategy**: High-level approach.
-   **Step Breakdown**: Numbered list of implementation steps with dependencies, linking to individual step files.
-   **Acceptance Criteria**: Overall feature completion criteria for the *new* feature.
-   **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies for the *new* feature.

### 2. Step-by-Step Implementation Files (`<feature_name>_step<number>.md`)
Each step file must include:
-   **Step Title & Dependencies**: What this step accomplishes and what must be completed first.
-   **Detailed Requirements**: Exact specifications for this step.
-   **Code Changes Required**: References to specific files to create/modify with detailed instructions, but no actual code snippets. **For any modifications or new files within an existing application directory (e.g., `src/item_system/` or `src/app_reducer/`), explicitly reference the relevant `src/<directory>/feature-description.md` file to provide context for the changes.**
-   **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing steps.
-   **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable criteria for step completion.
-   **Rollback Plan**: How to undo changes if issues arise.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
-   **No code in the planning folder**: All implementation code goes in appropriate `src/` directories.
-   **Follow existing patterns**: Use the established reducer patterns, context providers, and component structure.
-   **TypeScript compliance**: Ensure all new code follows existing TypeScript patterns.
-   **Material-UI consistency**: Use established design patterns and components.

### Integration Requirements
-   **Reducer Integration**: Add new actions to AppReducer if state changes are needed.
-   **Context Integration**: Use existing context providers or create new ones following the established pattern.
-   **Component Integration**: Follow the existing component hierarchy and prop patterns.
-   **Storage Integration**: If data persistence is needed, integrate with the existing localStorage implementation.

### Testing Strategy
-   **Component Tests**: Use existing testing patterns with Vitest and React Testing Library.
-   **Reducer Tests**: Test new actions and state changes.
-   **Integration Tests**: Test feature interaction with existing systems.
-   **Manual Testing**: Provide clear manual testing procedures.

---

## Quality Standards
-   All code must be production-ready.
-   No breaking changes to existing functionality.
-   Comprehensive error handling.
-   Accessibility compliance with Material-UI standards.
-   Performance considerations for the item system and execution views.

---

## Completion Process
1.  The user should be able to read the changes in the `master.md` file, and tell an agent to implement all steps according to the plan.
2.  Verify all acceptance criteria are met for the *new* feature.
3.  Run full test suite and ensure no regressions.
4.  Conduct manual testing of the complete feature.
5.  Delete the implementation plan folder (`<feature_name>_implementation_plan/`) after successful completion.

---

## Important Notes
-   The planning folder is temporary and should be removed after implementation.
-   All actual feature code belongs in the appropriate `src/` directories.
-   Each step should be fully testable before proceeding to the next.
-   Consider backward compatibility and data migration for any storage changes.
-   Follow the existing code style and architectural patterns throughout.
