The time increments need to auto-scale with the size of the item being viewed, and the user, instead of picking a time unit, needs to be able to pick small, medium and large sizes that correspond to 1 screen height per calendar duration, 2 screen heights per calendar duration, and 6 screen heights per calendar duration.

The scheduler needs to give the units in terms of offset from the current moment. That moment should be calculated when the user schedules the item. They should also be able to round to the nearest minute, hour, day, etc.

The ItemSchedule needs to show for only subcalendar items and there needs to be corresponding view types to view checklist items, basic items, and variables.

Scheduling children doesn't seem to allow for more than one child.

Checklists need filter options to do things like show only the top 3 items, show only started items, show only complete items, only pending items, etc.

Checklists and Sub Calendar items need to enable a prioritization decision from of users.

David says all priority levels need to show on the execution view... Or something
  Tanner says maybe we need another view.

Up next should show on the execution view
